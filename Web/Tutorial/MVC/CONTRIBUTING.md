## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY]/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Search the existing [Issues](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY]/issues) to see if your idea has already been suggested.
- If it hasn't, open a new issue and describe the enhancement you'd like to see, why you think it would be beneficial, and any implementation ideas you have.

### Pull Requests
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`).
- Make your changes.
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`).
- Open a Pull Request.
